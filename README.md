## MBA Decision Prediction Using Machine Learning

###  Project Title
"Will They Pursue an MBA?" â€” A Machine Learning Approach Aligned with SDG 4: Quality Education

### Objective
This project aims to build a predictive model that determines whether an individual is likely to pursue an MBA based on demographic, academic, and career-related features.

The goal aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education) by leveraging data-driven insights to understand access and motivation behind higher education decisions.

### Dataset Description

The dataset contains 10,000 entries with 20 features, including:

- Age, Gender, GPA, Work Experience
- GRE/GMAT scores, Salary (before/after MBA)
- Entrepreneurial interest, Networking importance
- MBA format, funding sources, and decision (Yes/No)

The target variable is: Decided to Pursue MBA?

### Tools & Technologies
Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn)

Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

XGBoost

Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
